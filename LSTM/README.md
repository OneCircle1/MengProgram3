# LSTM

LSTMs can be used to model univariate time series forecasting problems. These are problems comprised of a single series of observations and a model is required to learn from the series of past observations to predict the next value in the sequence.

# Instruction

Install pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, python3.

Run LSTM.py.

# Result

When the batch size is 20:

```python
mse: 0.29673335476669743
mae: 0.3973067512257079
```
